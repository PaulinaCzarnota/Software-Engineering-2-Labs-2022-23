This is a collection of my Software Engineering 2 labs completed in the second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin. 

Each lab utilizes the USE tool for modeling and SOIL (Structured Object-oriented Interaction Language) for specifying UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams.

# Lab Summaries

### Lab 1: Order Distributed System
This lab implements a customer order management system using UML concepts in USE and SOIL, showcasing classes for `Customer`, `Order`, and `Product` to manage customer orders and credit ratings.

### Lab 2: Employee Management System
This lab models an employee management system with pre- and postconditions for hiring and firing employees. It includes `Person`, `Contract`, and `Company` classes to ensure data integrity, designed using USE and SOIL.

### Lab 3: Enhanced Employee Management
This lab refines the employee management system by enhancing salary management and contract handling while maintaining pre- and postconditions for operations, utilizing USE and SOIL for design.

### Lab 4: Library System with State Machines
This lab focuses on a library system with a `Book` class, using state machines to manage statuses (available, unavailable, on reserve) and operations for borrowing and returning books, modeled with USE and SOIL.

### Lab 5: Extended Library System
This lab introduces the `Copy` class to manage individual book copies, enhancing the library model with operations for borrowing and returning copies, along with member management, all designed using USE and SOIL.

### Lab 6: Refined Library Management
This lab further refines the library system, improving the `Book`, `Copy`, and `Member` classes while managing borrowing limits and ensuring correct state transitions, employing USE and SOIL for modeling.
